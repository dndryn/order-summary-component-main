### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- npm
- Gulp


### What I learned
Conceptualizing a project, however small, can be extremely useful and maybe at times it can be the keystone for a scalable application ... I think. In this case, the use of tools like Sass helped me schematize and break up an annoying skein into minor problems.


### Continued development

I'll have to optimize the mobile compatibility with the use of mixins and give an additional boost to the animations, perhaps by creating a specific file.
